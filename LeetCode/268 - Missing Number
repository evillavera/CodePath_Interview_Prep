#Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], 
#return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.
#Will always start at 0, just find the missing number

#STRATEGY: 
#I was thinking about taking the whole sum of the array 
#This reminded me of a series using sigma
#Needed to refresh my memory on what the formula is to calculate the total sum 
#EQUATION : n (n + 1) / 2
#So first calculate what the total sum of the array should be based on its size
#Subtract by the total sum of the array 
def missingNumber(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    return (n * (n + 1) // 2) - sum(nums)
